/** This object contains methods that convert between Scala [[Future]] and Java [[CompletionStage]].
  *
  * The explicit conversion methods defined here are practical when writing Java code. For Scala
  * code, it is recommended to use the extension methods defined in [[FutureConverters.Ops]].
  *
  * Note that the bridge is implemented at the read-only side of asynchronous handles, namely
  * [[Future]] (instead of [[scala.concurrent.Promise]]) and [[CompletionStage]] (instead of
  * [[java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture]]). This is intentional, as the semantics of bridging
  * the write-handles would be prone to race conditions; if both ends (`CompletableFuture` and
  * `Promise`) are completed independently at the same time, they may contain different values
  * afterwards. For this reason, `toCompletableFuture` is not supported on the created
  * `CompletionStage`s.
